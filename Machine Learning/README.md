# Machine Learning

This folder contains my **introductory machine learning projects**.  
The work here focuses on applying machine learning concepts to real datasets using Python, with emphasis on understanding models rather than blind prediction.

Projects follow a structured approach: data preparation → modeling → evaluation.
